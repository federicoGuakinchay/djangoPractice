# Implement Caching for a High-Traffic Page

Objective: Optimize a high-traffic page in Django by implementing caching mechanisms.

 + Requirements:

    1. Identify a specific view that fetches data from the database.
    2. Implement Django’s caching framework for that view (e.g., per-view or template fragment caching).
    3. Add caching invalidation when the data in the database changes.

 + Technical Concepts:

    1. Django’s caching framework
    2. Cache backends (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
    3. Query optimization with Django ORM

 + Bonus:

    1. Add a real-time element to the page (e.g., using WebSockets or Django Channels) and decide how caching should work for that.
    2. Implement more advanced caching strategies (e.g., view-based and low-level caching).
