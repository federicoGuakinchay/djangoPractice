# Implement User Authentication with Django

Objective: Build a user registration and login system using Django’s built-in authentication system.

 + Requirements:

   1. Implement user registration with email and password validation.
   2. Implement user login with session-based authentication or token-based (DRF JWT).
   3. Protect an endpoint (e.g., /profile/) that only authenticated users can access.
   4. Provide a password reset feature using Django’s built-in password reset.

 + Technical Concepts:
    
    1. Django authentication system
    2. Middleware for authentication
    3. Django views, forms, and templates
    4. CSRF protection

 + Bonus:

    1. Add email confirmation for registration using Django signals.
    2. Implement user role-based access (e.g., regular user vs admin).
