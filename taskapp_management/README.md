# Build a Simple API for Task Management

Objective: Create a simple REST API to manage tasks, including creating, updating, deleting, and listing tasks.

Requirements:

 + A task should have a title, description, is_completed, and created_at fields.
 + Users should be able to:
    1. Create a new task.
    2. Retrieve a list of all tasks (with filtering options for completed/not completed).
    3. Update a task's title or description.
    4. Mark a task as complete.
    5. Delete a task.
 + Technical Concepts:
    1. Django models
    2. Django REST framework (DRF) or Djangoâ€™s built-in views
    3. Serialization
    4. URL routing
    5. CRUD operations
 + Bonus:
    1. Add pagination for listing tasks.
    2. Implement filters for retrieving completed and non-completed tasks.
    3. Write unit tests for the API.
